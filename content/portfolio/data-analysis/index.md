I have experience in conducting a wide range of Data Analysis and presenting the insights in many formats ranging from reports in PDF or HTML formats, dashboards through tools or code and presentations.

I have completed several analysis as example:

- Exploratory Analysis
- Financial Analysis
- Various correlation and statistical analysis to unveil relationships and effects

and more.

Examples of analysis and reports will be added in the upcoming future!
