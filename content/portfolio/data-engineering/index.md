I have developed ETL solutions and created a large amount of efficient and robust data pipelines. 

I have professional experience using the following toolkit for data engineering based tasks:

- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#macros)
- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)
- [Gitlab (CI/CD)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [BigQuery - GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
