I have developed several {shiny} applications which are hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). 

### [Outlier Detection](https://github.com/nrennie/OutlierApp)

An R shiny dashboard based on my PhD research to detect outliers in functional time series data occurring in a network in an online setting. Accompanies the paper titled ["Detecting outlying demand in multi-leg bookings for transportation networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04157).

### [Life Expectancy](https://github.com/nrennie/Significance/tree/main/Were_not_getting_any_younger_Or_should_that_be_older)  

An R shiny dashboard to accompany my Significance article [Weâ€™re not getting any younger! Or should that be older?](https://www.significancemagazine.com/science/723-we-re-not-getting-any-younger-or-should-that-be-older) which investigates trends in life expectancy.

### [aRt](https://github.com/nrennie/nrennie_aRt)

An R shiny application to generate and download generative art created in R.



### [shinytweet](https://github.com/nrennie/shinytweet)

A simple R shiny application to browse tweets related to R, Python, and data science. This app uses GitHub actions to automatically update data and redeploy the shiny app.

Read my [blog post](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/2022-10-05-automatically-deploying-a-shiny-app-for-browsing-rstats-tweets-with-github-actions/) on creating this Shiny app for more information.
