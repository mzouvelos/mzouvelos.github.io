Automated reporting is a useful tool in reducing the likelihood of human error, making analysis more transparent, and decreasing the amount of time spent creating repetitive reports. 

I have extensive experience in this domain in creating large-scale parametirized reports with the usage of both Python and R, specifically utilizing [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) as a publishing system and rendering in different formats, as PDF for more formal and static needs, as well as, HTML where interactivity and more complex needs are required.

As an example, during my tenure in bol (bol.com) I have created from scratch a wide-reaching automatically generated parametirized report, that provides in an individual HTML file all the performance data for all advertisers, with which other teams can then assess the performance of each advertiser and prepare their Quarterly Business Reviews with the advertisers, saving a considerable amount of time from data collection and avoiding previously occurring manual mistakes, as well as, providing additional insights and ready to use graphs to create a narrative and communicate the data in a compelling way.

Post about how to create such reports utilizing parameters and being able to scale in any data focused programming language will be posted soon and attached here!
