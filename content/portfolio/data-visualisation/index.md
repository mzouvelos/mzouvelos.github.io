Data visualisation is essential for exploratory analysis, and for effectively communicating results. Although I primarily use R for data visualisation, I also have experience of using Python, Tableau, rawgraphs, Inkscape, and Figma. I began researching what makes an effective data visualisation during my PhD when trying to visualise large volumes of data, and started contributing to #TidyTuesday!

### #TidyTuesday
[#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data.

### #30DayChartChallenge
The #30DayChartChallenge is a data visualisation challenge where participants make one chart each day, inspired by the daily prompt. The prompts are split across 5 categories. I used a range of tools to create my charts, including R, Python, Tableau, rawgraphs, Inkscape, and Figma. Most of the charts were built in R, but I used at least one *new* tool for each of the five categories.

### DuBois Challenge
The [DuBois Challenge](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge) is part of a celebration of the data visualization legacy of W.E.B DuBois which attempts to recreate the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools. 

Note that the text in the visualisations is taken from the original charts and uses antiquated terms to refer to populations of colour.

### #TableauTuesday
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb) is an interactive data visualization tool, used to make plots, dashboards, and presentations of data. Although I primarily use R to create plots and dashboards for visualising data, I've recently started to explore less-programmatic ways of visualising data. My Tableau data visualisations and dashboards can be found on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nicola.rennie/). In order to improve my Tableau skills, I've started visualising #TidyTuesday data sets in Tableau as well as in R.
