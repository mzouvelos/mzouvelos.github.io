I have experience in both professional and non-professional formats of applying machine learning models, supporting the whole process, from conception to deployment.

I have developed both classification and regression models, as well as, time series based forecasting. Following some examples:

### Professional Applications

- Revenue Forecasting Model
- Ad Inventory Forecast
- Forum Text Classification

### Kaggle Competitions

- ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions (top 30%)

Posts upon machine learning will follow in the upcoming future!
