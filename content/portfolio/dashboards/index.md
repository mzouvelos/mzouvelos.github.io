 I have experience in developing dashboards using different approaches and always following the main elements of efficient dashboard design and data visualization to accomodate reporting needs and tracking of KPI's.

 I have developed a significant amount of dashboards with dashboarding tools like Tableau but also in coding formats using frameworks like Shiny and Streamlit.
