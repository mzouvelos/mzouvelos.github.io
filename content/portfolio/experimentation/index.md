I have experience in the whole process of designing and analyzing A/B experiments in a product based format to  ensure integrity of the experiment procedure and assess the statistical effect.

- Designing controlled trial A/B experiments
- Analysing results with appropriate statistical methods
- Designing data visualisations and creating reports to communicate results and uplift
- Interpreting results and suggesting future action plans and potential next step experiments as an iterative process
 
Example post to follow!
